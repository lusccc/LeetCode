## 191. Number of 1 Bits
Difficulty: Easy  
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.  

#### 解法
运用位运算来判断最后一位是不是1，然后配合无符号右移（就是左补0）来计算1的个数。  
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
   public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            if ((n & 1) == 1) {
                result++;
            }
            n >>>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
