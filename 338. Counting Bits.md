## 338. Counting Bits
Difficulty: Medium  

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.
计算[0,num]每个数字的1的位数  
Example:  
`For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].`  

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?  
Space complexity should be O(n).  
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like `__builtin_popcount` in c++ or in any other language.

Hint:

1.You should make use of what you have produced already. (动态规划)  
2.Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.  
3.Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?  

#### 解法
首先O(n*sizeof(integer))谁都想得到。

An easy recurrence for this problem is `f[i] = f[i / 2] + i % 2.`  
动态规划关键就是求出这个递推式。 上面这个递推式的意义就是：  
```
f[1111] = f[111] + f[1]
```
挺巧妙的

```java
public int[] countBits(int num) {
    int[] f = new int[num + 1];
    for (int i=1; i<=num; i++) f[i] = f[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
    return f;
}
```
