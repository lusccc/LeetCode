#### O(1) Space Solution

1.Use two pointers, walker and runner.  
2.walker moves step by step. runner moves two steps at time.  
3.if the Linked List has a cycle walker and runner will meet at some point.    
简单来说就是两个指针，一个每次走一步，一个每次走两步，如果有环的话，迟早他们两个会相遇的，这和平时操场跑圈一样嘛，跑的快的迟早超过跑得慢的。  
```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if(head==null) return false;
        ListNode walker = head;
        ListNode runner = head;
        while(walker != null && runner != null) {
             walker = walker.next;
            runner = runner.next;
            if (runner != null)
                runner = runner.next;
            if (walker == runner) return true;
        }
        return false;
}
```
